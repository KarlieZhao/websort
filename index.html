            “Ars longa,” the ancient saying goes, “vita brevis.” Art is long, life short, and the problem is intensifying. As the literary ars lurches exponentially more longa — accommodating the printing press, “Gravity’s Rainbow,” Google Books — our collective
            TBR pile towers ever more vertiginously overhead. Which raises a question: What are we mortal beings supposed to do with all these books? Franco Moretti has a solution: don’t read them. Moretti is not a satirist. He’s an Italian literary scholar
            and the founder of the Stanford Literary Lab, </div> which opened last year, published its maiden pamphlet in January and followed up with another last month. The first pamphlet asks whether computers can recognize literary genres,
        and the second uses network theory to re-envision plots.

        As its name suggests, the Lit Lab tackles literary problems by scientific means: hypothesis-testing, computational modeling, quantitative analysis. Similar efforts are currently proliferating under the broad rubric of “digital humanities,” but Moretti’s
        approach is among the more radical. He advocates what he terms “distant reading”: understanding literature not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data.
